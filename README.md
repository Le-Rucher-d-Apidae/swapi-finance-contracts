## Running
These contracts are compiled and deployed using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/). They can also be run using the Remix IDE.

To prepare the dev environment, run `yarn install`. To compile the contracts, run `yarn compile`. Yarn is available to install [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#debian-stable) if you need it.

## Accessing the ABI
If you need to use any of the contract ABIs, you can install this repo as an npm package with `npm install --dev @swapi-finance//contracts`. Then import the ABI like so: `import { abi as IUniswapV2PairABI } from '@swapi-finance//contracts/artifacts/contracts/swapi-core/interfaces/IUniswapV2Pair.sol/IUniswapV2Pair.json'`.

## Attribution

# Warning

## First Forge tests compilation
In case compilation fails with the following error:
```
[â Š] Compiling...
Error:
Encountered invalid solc version in test/StakingRewards.t.sol: Failed to parse solidity version >= 0.6.0 <=0.8.0: unexpected character ',' while parsing major version number
```

Set the solc version by adding in foundry.toml:
```
  auto_detect_solc = false
  solc = "0.8.23"
```
run once then revert the changes.

## Tests

tests contracts compilation takes up to 20+ Gb of RAM, so be sure to have enough memory available before doing so.

Github actions for running tests are disabled for now, as they are not able to compile the contracts due to the memory limit (12-16 Gb).
```

Tests currently not working:
 - test/eth-token-recover
